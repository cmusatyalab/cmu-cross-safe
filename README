## Setup
1. Clone the [tensorflow/models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models) repository so some location on the 
   server that you would like to train the model on. 
2. Install the Object Detection model by follwing [these instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md).
    1. The <models repository location>/research/ and <models repository location>/research/slim directories 
       must be in your PYTHONPATH every time you use this model. 
    2. The "<models repository location>/research/object_detection/builders/model_builder_test.py" test
       should pass after you finish the installation steps. If you run into any problems, using this model,
       ensure that this test still passes.
